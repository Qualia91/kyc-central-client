## Unreleased

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-13

First public release.

### Added

- `KYCCentral` client covering every documented `/v1` endpoint: companies, assessments,
  rules and rule sets, sanctions, adverse media, offshore leaks, FCA, GLEIF, individual
  insolvency, Charity Commission, HMRC VAT, FATF and offshore jurisdictions, AI analysis,
  the documentation assistant, and health.
- Typed `Assessment`, `RiskFlag` and `RuleResult` shapes, with helper functions
  (`isClear`, `isPartial`, `flagsAt`, `flagsAtOrAbove`, `hasFlag`, `findFlag`) that keep
  the assessment a plain, serialisable object.
- Transparent polling of queued assessments: a `202 Accepted` job response is polled to
  completion and resolved as a finished `Assessment`. Opt out with `wait: false`.
- Typed error hierarchy under `KYCCentralError`, with `RateLimitError.retryAfter` and
  structured validation errors on `UnprocessableEntityError.body`.
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff and jitter for timeouts, connection errors
  and retryable statuses, honouring `Retry-After`. Client errors are never retried, and
  a caller-initiated abort is never retried either.
- `AbortSignal` support on every method, combined with the client's own timeout.
- Custom `fetch` injection for proxying, tracing and tests.
- API key resolution from `KYCCENTRAL_API_KEY`, base URL from `KYCCENTRAL_BASE_URL`,
  guarded so the package still loads in runtimes with no `process`.
- Anonymous use for endpoints that permit it, so the library can be tried without an
  account.
- Zero runtime dependencies; ESM and CJS builds with TypeScript declarations.
