## Unreleased

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-13

First public release.

### Added

- `KYCCentral.new/1` plus resource modules covering every documented `/v1` endpoint:
  `Companies`, `KYC`, `Jobs`, `RuleSets`, `Rules`, `Sanctions`, `News`, `OffshoreLeaks`,
  `FCA`, `GLEIF`, `IndividualInsolvency`, `Charity`, `HMRCVat`, `Jurisdictions`,
  `OffshoreJurisdictions`, `Analysis`, `Docs`, and health.
- `KYCCentral.Assessment` struct with `RiskFlag` and `RuleResult`, atom severities and
  statuses, and helpers: `clear?/1`, `partial?/1`, `flags_at/2`, `flags_at_or_above/2`,
  `has_flag?/2`, `flag/2`, `rules_with_status/2`.
- Transparent polling of queued assessments: a `202 Accepted` job response is polled to
  completion and returned as a finished `Assessment`. Opt out with `wait: false`.
- `KYCCentral.Error`, a single exception struct carrying a `:kind` atom, so failures
  pattern-match without a tree of exception modules. Includes `:retry_after` on rate
  limits and flattened FastAPI validation detail.
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff and jitter for timeouts, connection errors
  and retryable statuses, honouring `Retry-After`. Client errors are never retried.
- Default transport on OTP's `:httpc` with TLS verification configured explicitly
  (`verify_peer`, OS trust store, hostname checking, TLS 1.2/1.3), leaving Jason as the
  only runtime dependency.
- `:http` option to swap in Req, Finch, Tesla or a test stub.
- API key resolution from `KYCCENTRAL_API_KEY`, base URL from `KYCCENTRAL_BASE_URL`.
- Anonymous use for endpoints that permit it, so the library can be tried without an
  account.
